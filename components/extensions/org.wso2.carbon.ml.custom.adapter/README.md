ML Custom Adapter Extension
===========================

This OSGi bundle demonstrates how you could extend WSO2 ML input/output adapters.

1. This bundle is a fragment bundle of org.wso2.carbon.ml.core bundle.
2. You can build the bundle and copy it into {ML_HOME}/repository/components/dropis folder.
3. Once you copy the bundle, you could configure new adapter using {ML_HOME}/repository/conf/machine-learner.xml file.
